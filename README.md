# GitHub Pages Resume Starter

This is a minimal, accessible one-page resume you can host on GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Replace placeholders in `index.html` with your real info (name, links, jobs, etc.).
2. Commit both files to a repository named **`YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`** (replace with your GitHub username, lowercase).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**. Select branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`, Save.
4. Visit `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`

Optional:
- Turn on **Enforce HTTPS** in Settings → Pages.
- Add a custom domain (Settings → Pages → Custom domain), then add the DNS CNAME at your registrar.

Accessibility tips:
- Keep headings in order (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`).
- Use meaningful link text (avoid "click here").
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.
